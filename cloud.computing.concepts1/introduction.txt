What a cloud is?

Cloud = Lots of storage + compute cycles nearby

Moore's Law: CPU compute capacity doubles once about every 18 months
storage: 12 months
bandwidth: 9 months

1) Massive scale

WUE - water usage efficiency = Annual Water Usage / IT Equipment Energy (L/kWh)
PUE = Total Facility Power / IT Equipment Power

2) On-demand access

HaaS
IaaS
PaaS
SaaS

3) Data-intensive Nature

Computation-Intesive Computing: High performance computing, Grids
Data-Intensive: store data at datacenters and use compute nodes nearby
-The focus shifts from computation to the data: CPU utilization no longer the most important resource metric, instead I/O is (disk and/or network)

4) New Cloud Programming Paradigms

Single site cloud: To outsource or Own?

- Breakeven points to outsorce
 * Months > 5.5 (storage) 
 * Months > 12 (overall)
