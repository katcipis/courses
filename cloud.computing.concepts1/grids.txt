HPC - High Performance Computing
- a lot of CPU computing compared to the data 
- computer with 256 process

DAG - Direct Acyclic Graph
           Job 1
- Job 0 ->       -> Job 3
           Job 2

- Job1 and Job 2 can be concurrent

- 4 stages: Init, Stage In, Execute, Stage Out, Publish
- May take several hours/days
- Computation Intensive, so Massively Parallel

# Scheduling Problem:

- Intra-site protocol:
 * HTCondor protocol
 * Internal scheduling and allocation resources
 * Monitoring
 * Distribution and Publishing Files

- Inter-site protocol (across site):
 * Globus protocol
 * External scheduling and allocating
 * Stage In and Stage Out of Files
 * Open Grid
 * Globus Toolkit
